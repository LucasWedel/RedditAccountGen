# Reddit Account Generator (Fixed)

100% educational purposes and not for r/place

 **WHAT IS IT?**
 
 This is a semi-automatic Reddit account generator. I'm saying "semi-automatic" because it still requires a Google Captcha to be completed at the end of the creation process.

 **HOW DOES IT WORK?**
 
 This script was made for quickly creating Reddit throwaways. _See my other project -- the Reddit Account Deleter, which is made to completly erase Reddit accounts (including comments and all)._
 It generates an username derived from a Wikipedia:Random article, and then appending some random digits to it as to have it be unique. Then, it completes the Reddit sign-up process, leaving you only to complete the Captcha at the end.
 
 **REQUIREMENTS**

 After cloning the repo, inside this directory run the following to install the necessary dependencies:

 ```console
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

 Additionally, a file named "namesforreddit.txt" should be in the same folder as the .py executable, where your accounts will be saved.

 **HOW TO USE**
 
 After installing dependencies, run namesforreddit.py and you'll be greeted by a PySimpleGUI GUI.
 
 **HOW TO USE AFTER INSTALLATION**

First run, you will receive gui and just click generate.
It will open a few pages to generate names+passwords, ignore that. 
You will now see Browsec VPN, download this so we can go around the 10+min cooldown timer.
On reddit you will have to complete CAPTCHA yourself.
After CAPTCHA is completed, go to settings and confirm the mail from 1secmail
Now you are finished, you will see your login in namesforreddit.txt
